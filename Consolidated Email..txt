Create a pipeline view: Go to the Jenkins dashboard and click on the "+" icon to create a new view. Choose "List View" and give it a name. Add the pipelines that you want to monitor to the view.

Configure the post-build action: Go to the configuration page of each pipeline and add a post-build action to send an email. Choose "Editable Email Notification" and enter the recipients and other details. In the "Content" section, choose "Use Default Content" and select the email template that you configured in step 3.

That's it! Jenkins will now send a consolidated email to the recipients with the build status of all the pipelines in the view
